# TriggerCondition

A small MIDI plugin which filters note-on messages based on probability or a fixed interval.

Took the idea from the Elektron instrument lineup which features a similar (but more advanced :)) feature.


TODO:
* Add units to slider display
* Make "logo" look a little nicer, maybe a different color on one word
* Use 1 knob for both periodic- and probabilitymode
* Implement more ratios, it should be able to set it to a 3:2 ratio for example
